Love Button Fun ❤️
Welcome to the Love Button Fun website, where love always wins! 💘 This is a simple yet cheeky project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to spread some lighthearted fun.

🖱️ How It Works
The website asks you the all-important question: Do you love me? 😍
There are two buttons: YES and NO.
But here's the twist... every time you try to click NO, it runs away! 🚀 You can never say no. (Ha, gotcha! 😜)
Eventually, you’ll give up and press YES—and when you do, you’ll get the sweetest reply: I love you too, pookie! 🥰
🚀 Features
Interactive Buttons: Try clicking "No" if you dare. 👀
Sweet Message: Love is inevitable, my friend.
Simple and Fun: Built with minimal code, maximum laughs!
